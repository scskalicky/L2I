    - time limit for each unit, 400ms * number of words
5. after the three units, a tf question appeared
    - also timed and stayed on screen for 400ms * number of words
6 then participants saw the true/false prompt screen and had 1800ms to register their response
    - press "x" for true, "y" for false
7 half did experimentA, half did experimentB, with practice being the same. 
8. controlled for handedness by counterbalancing the response options
