notes


- make a second version which can replicate the Polish one. 


data save

- master csv which includes contact info (the code sheet), and allows for easier knowledge of who took the experiment...or use the qualtrics approach. 
- can't get triggers unless i forward to qualtrics, so just don't worry about it?
